## Inspiration

## What it does

## How I built it
This project was primarily built in three major phases.
## Challenges I ran into

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

## What I learned
There was a lot that we learnt from this project. Firstly, we all learnt how to work as a team and co-ordinate with one another to 
complete the tasks by the main deadline. Since we are all university students, our resources and overall budget for producing expensive hardware 
were very limited. Hence, we had to make the best use of the amount of money we could afford to spend in order to make working hardware that would give 
us accurate results. Furthermore, we all learnt a little bit about one other's key traits. For example, the front end developer learnt a lot about hardware
development while the back-end developer learnt a lot about front-end web development too. Overall, we think that this project was certainly a great experience
and there was a lot that we learnt from it.

## What's next for test

Format your description with Markdown. Here are some tips:

## Headline
**bold**
_ italics _
[link](http://foo.bar)
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)
        
Get fancy with syntax highlighting:

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
