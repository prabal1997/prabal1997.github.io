## Inspiration

## What it does

## How I built it
This project was primarily built in three major phases.
## Challenges I ran into
One of the main challenges that we ran into was how to make the wireless sensors inexpensive so that we can produce many of them on 
a small budget. We ended up creating our own flex sensor using tinfoil as conductive layers and pencilled in paper as the semi-resistive layer. For 
the case we used sharpeners that collected the shavings where we removed the actual sharpener part and put in our electronics. We also used lipo 
batteries from an RC plane for power in order to make our sensors rechargeable. Everything was controlled by an inexpensive Arduino Pro Mini. 

On the front end side of the website, one of the challenges we ran into was figuring out how to display so much of data on a single screen 
without crashing the website from data overload. This included the real time data, the trendline and the recorded ergonmic efficiency of the person.
A lot of repetitive iterations were required in order to come up with a decent looking website which enhances user experience of the interface.
Another challenge was that we had to poll the frequency at which data was displayed on the website, especially on the realtime graph so that we don't
utilize high amount of CPU.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are really proud of developing the hardware for our project. We think that it proves that the entire Accutrack system is something that 
actually works as we were able to show exactly how we envisioned it. 

## What I learned
There was a lot that we learnt from this project. Firstly, we all learnt how to work as a team and co-ordinate with one another to 
complete the tasks by the main deadline. Since we are all university students, our resources and overall budget for producing expensive hardware 
were very limited. Hence, we had to make the best use of the amount of money we could afford to spend in order to make working hardware that would give 
us accurate results. We also learnt extensively about several new Microsoft technologies such as Azure Functions etc. These technologies made our tasks
much easier since they consisted several useful functions.
Furthermore, we all learnt a little bit about one other's key traits. 
For example, the front end developer learnt a lot about hardware
development while the back-end developer learnt a lot about front-end web development too. Overall, we think that this project was certainly a great experience
and there was a lot that we learnt from it.
